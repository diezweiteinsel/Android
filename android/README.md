The starting point 'Android Studio demo project' was made by Lukas Damerau (lda), Alexander Krause-Glau (akr), Henning Schnoor (hs), Natalie Kaufhold (nka), and Sandro Esquivel (sae) for CAU Kiel Softwareprojekt.

# How to start
- Open in Android Studio with **Open** in the welcome dialog. Android Studio will download all dependencies (Gradle project), this might take a moment as indicated by the bottom right progress bar.

# How to run on virtual device
- Run with **Run -> Run app...** (Shift+F10)
- Create virtual device (e.g. Resizable (Experimental))
- Select virtual device to run on
- (Optional) You might need to change the `USED_URL` in the `DefaultAppContainer` class.

# How to run on real device
- Activate developer mode (e.g. on ASUS Nexus 7 (tap build number in **Setting -> About this device** 7 times))
- Connect your device via USB (confirm to allow USB debugging)
- (Optional) Setup port forward for the Spring backend with `adb` command line tools, e.g., `adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080`). The Android device can now reach the Spring-based backend on `localhost:8080`, you can test that via your mobile browser.
- (Optional) You might need to change the `USED_URL` in the `DefaultAppContainer` class.
- Run with **Run -> Run app...** (Shift+F10)
- Select device to run on

# Employed languages & technologies
- Kotlin 
  - [Beginner tour](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-tour-hello-world.html) 
  - [Intermediate tour](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/kotlin-tour-intermediate-extension-functions.html)
- IDE: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
- Network: [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/), [OkHttp](https://square.github.io/okhttp)
- (Database: [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room))
  - Recommendation (if offline support is not required): Start by implementing all features without a Room database, fetching only the data you need from the network.

# How to reset local database?
- Uninstall app and redeploy via Android Studio.

# What is missing?
- More meaningful testing
- Proper documentation of local database (Room) and network requests (Retrofit)
